=== Using the Ruby SDK Command Line tool to create projects
by Jakub Mahnert

==== Problem
You would like to create a GoodData project and use it to do great things

==== Preamble

All of the following are bash lines, please enter them in your terminal of choice. `jq` is used in the examples to parse the JSON responses in bash.

This chapter assumes that you know how to authenticate - check the <<01_intro.asciidoc,Intro>> chapter if that's not the case. To create a project, you have to have an Authorization (Project) token as a part of the authentication data.

==== Solution

Creating a project is as simple as

`gooddata project create`

You can easily chain multiple calls to the gooddata command line tool using `bash` and `jq`

`gooddata api get $(gooddata project create | jq -r '.project.links.projectFeatureFlags') | jq`
