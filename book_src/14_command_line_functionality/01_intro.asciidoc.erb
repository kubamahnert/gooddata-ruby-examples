=== Leveraging the Ruby SDK Command Line functionality
by Jakub Mahnert

==== Problem
You would like to make a simple request to the GoodData API


==== Preamble

All of the following are bash lines, please enter them in your terminal of choice. `jq` is used in the examples to parse the JSON responses in bash.

==== Solution

There are two principal ways to authenticate - either pass the credentials and server settings with each call as command line parameters:

`gooddata -U username -P password -s https://custom-domain.gooddata.com api get /gdc/md`

Notice how the named parameters are between `gooddata` and the command `api get`

A complete list of the available command line parameters are available by running `gooddata --help`

The other way to authenticate is to run the authentication wizard, which will store your credentials and server settings at `~/.gooddata`

`gooddata auth store`

After storing your credentials, making requests is as easy as

`gooddata api get /gdc/md`
