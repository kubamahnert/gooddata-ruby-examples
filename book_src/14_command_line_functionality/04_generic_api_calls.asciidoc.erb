=== Using the Ruby SDK Command Line tool to make generic requests to GoodData API
by Jakub Mahnert

==== Problem
You would like to make requests to any API endpoint yourself

==== Preamble

All of the following are bash lines, please enter them in your terminal of choice. `jq` is used in the examples to parse the JSON responses in bash.

This chapter assumes that you know how to authenticate - check the <<01_intro.asciidoc,Intro>> chapter if that's not the case.

==== Solution

The API currently knows how to make GET, POST and DELETE requests.

GET and DELETE are both straightforward:

`gooddata api get /gdc/md`
`gooddata api delete /gdc/projects/project_id`

POST requires a payload, which you should save as a JSON into a file and feed it as a parameter to the CL tool:

`echo '{"name": "gd_ruby_cmd_test", "type" : "etl","component": {"name": "gdc-etl-sql-executor", "version":"1"}}' > process.json`
`gooddata api post /gdc/dataload_path/ process.json`

In case the payload is empty, no parameter needs to be passed

`gooddata api post /gdc/projects/project_id/execute`
